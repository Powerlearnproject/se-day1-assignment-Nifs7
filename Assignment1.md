Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
**Software is the systematic application of engineering principles methods and tools to the development of software systems. In technology, it has had an impact in the creation of software applications that are used in various aspects of modern life.**

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
**It's establishment as a discipline in the 1960s, the advent of structured programming in the 1970s, and the rise of agile methodologies**

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
-**Requirement analysis; gathering information on user needs, and system requirements**
-**Design; creating detailed designs of software and user interface**
-**Implementation; writing code, building software**
-**Testing; testing for standard quality and functional requirements**
-**Deployment; the release to the user**
-**Maintenance; ongoing support, enhancement and updates**

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
**In comparison, both are methodologies used in software development for high quality software.**
**Waterfall methodology uses a sequential approach that is structured in such a way that phases are completed one after the other. Agile methodology on the other hand, uses an incremental iterative technique, that allows for continuous change.**
**Waterfall methodology would be appropriate where the system requirements are fixed like a banking app. Agile methodology would be useful in software requiring frequent updates and feedback like social media applications.**

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
-**Software developer**; coding and implementation
-**Quality assuarance engineer**; designing and executing tests
-**Project manager**; overseeing the planning, execution and delivery of projects

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
**Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)**: Software suites that provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing code eg Visual Studio, Eclipse.
**Version Control Systems (VCS)**: Software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members  eg Git, Subversion.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Changing Requirements, tight deadlines, technical debt
Strategies for overcoming challenges include effective communication, agile methodologies, prioritization of tasks, and regular reassessment of project goals and timelines.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
**Unit testing**; individual testing of compnents of the software. Helps catch bugs early on.
**Intergration testing**; tests the interaction of different modules. ensures smooth communication between modules.
**System testing**; entire application testing. ensures the system meets all requiremnets. 
**Acceptance testing**; against user requirements.Ensures the software is ready for deployment.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
**It is the process of crafting questions and statements ti get the best possible response from an AI model.It enables one to get accurate, relevant, efficient and productive feedback.**

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
**Vague prompt**; What is the history of paleontology?
**Improved prompt**; Give me a chronological listed account of how the study of paleontology began with relevant time codes.
